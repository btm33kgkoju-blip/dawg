        <h2>Facts about dogs</h2>
         <p>
             Dogs are very loyal creatures belonging to the wolf family.Dogs have a sense of sound 
           but they don't have the "concept" of time.Unlike humans dogs don't have an ability to
           create measures of time like seconds, minutes, hours, days, etc.So,telling them that,
           "I'll be back in 15 minutes" wouldn't help much but we think that we need to do it.
           Dogs are capable of being trained based on previous events.

        <h2>History of Dogs</h2>
         <p>
            Dogs came from grey wolves, a process of domestication developed about 20,000 and 40,000 
          years ago.Early domestication was most likely unconcious;"proto-domestication" which were 
          likely driven by some scavengigng wolves that came near human settlement.This led them to be 
          split from their wolf herds before the modern agriculture. Over thousands of years the split 
          lineage developed in living with humans and their evolution developed within an intensional and 
          unintensional brredin with two species of dogs.
